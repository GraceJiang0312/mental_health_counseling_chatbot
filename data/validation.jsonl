Why this is happening and what can I do about it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is something I have\nhad to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my\npractice's focuses. \u00a0The answer can depend upon several reasons all which\ntend to be explored while in session. \u00a0If you or your counselor utilizes\nan integral approach, in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the\nfour irreducible perspectives (subjective, intersubjective, objective and\ninterobjective \u2013 also known as the four quadrants) in determining where the\nchallenges are, it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing\nto or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the\nsituation.In this case, from the upper-right\nor behavioral and physical perspective, we would want to make sure there is no\nphysical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor\nand have the basics checked (such as blood pressure.\u00a0 We would also look at particular behaviors to\nsee if you are doing something with is effecting performance (such as\nmasturbating often or being influenced by pornography).\u00a0Next we would look at the\nupper left quadrant (thoughts, cognitions, identity, feelings) to look at what\nis going on here both during sexual activities and at other times.\u00a0 If you are worried about your job, your\nfamily or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate, this can\ncontribute to your situation.\u00a0 From there\nwe would turn to the lower left quadrant (cultural rules and tools) to see who\nyou have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for\nways to shift, update and/or reshape the way you view sex and its\nchallenges.\u00a0 It would be here that we\nwould see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based\nupon how your family/culture of origin views the profession.\u00a0Finally, we would need to\naccount for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant (systems, laws,\nrules of society) such as your economic ability to try services and products as\nwell as whether such services and products were even available.\u00a0 Once we have rolled through these areas it\nthen becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at\nfurther in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just\ngetting a blood pressure medication is all you need.To sum your question then\nof why you can\u2019t keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts (look\nat your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after), look at\nyour behaviors, look at your physical body for issues, look at where you picked\nup your rules and tools (culture) and look at your ability to access goods and\nservices.\u00a0 They all contribute equally\nand need to be taken into account.\u00a0 So - as you can see, there is no one possible answer to this, but several. \u00a0I hope this helps."}]}
